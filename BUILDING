## Prerequisites

You need C++17 (or higher) compiler and Qt 6 development distribution.
In Ubuntu 22.04 LTS, for example, the packages qt6-base-dev is required.

Windows users may use Qt 6.5 or later for native dark mode support.

## Building VSE-Previewer from source:

1) make sure you meet the above prerequisites;
2) open the system terminal and change working directory to the "pro" directory in the source tree;
3) execute following command to generate the Makefile and other intermediate files

    `qmake -norecursive vse-previewer.pro CONFIG+=release`
    
    In some distros you may use `qmake6` instead of `qmake`;
4) "make" the Makefile with platform specific make-tool, e.g. `nmake release` for MS Visual Studio.

The program files will be built in compiler specific sub-directory in the "build" directory in source tree and ready to use.

Below are some tested compilers:

    Windows     MSVC
    Linux       GCC
    MacOS       clang (within brew)
