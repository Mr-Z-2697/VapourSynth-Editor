THIS MANUAL IS A DRAFT. PLEASE REPORT ANY MISTAKES OR ADDITIONS AT https://github.com/YomikoR/VapourSynth-Editor/issues

## Prerequisites

You need C++17 (or higher) compiler and Qt 6 development distribution.
In Ubuntu 22.04 LTS, for example, the packages qt6-base-dev and libqt6websockets6-dev are required.

## Building VapourSynth Editor from source:

1) make sure you meet the above prerequisites;
2) open the system terminal and change working directory to the "pro" directory in the source tree;
3) execute following command to generate the Makefile and other intermediate files

    `qmake -norecursive pro.pro CONFIG+=release`
    
    In some distros you may use `qmake6` instead of `qmake`;
4) "make" the Makefile with platform specific make-tool, e.g. `nmake` for MS Visual Studio.

The program files will be built in compiler specific sub-directory in the "build" directory in source tree and ready to use.

If you encounter path issues during the building related to missing headers, etc., you may include them in the file "pro/local_quirks.pri".

Below are some tested compilers:

    Windows     MSVC
    Linux       GCC
    MacOS       clang (within brew)
